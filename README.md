# nycnoise

## what is this

a rewrite of nyc-noise.com to move away from WordPress, make it easier to update the calendar, and hopefully offer more features and make the sites friendlier/easier to use, etc.

## plan

very broadly:

- get something up and running
- iterate until we have some feature parity with the existing site
- release it in alpha form?
- swap out the current site for this?

less broadly:

- reimplement features: TODO list them...
- bring over all static content from wordpress i.e. pages -- conserve URLs!
- have to ability to re-edit any of the past pages/static content
- potentially look into django only serving as an api and using a cdn-distributed next.js middle/frontend for the frontend (using netlify?)
