## what is this

a Python/Django rewrite of the [nyc-noise.com](https://nyc-noise.com/) cultural calendar web site to move it away from WordPress, make it easier to update the calendar, and hopefully offer more features and make the sites friendlier/easier to use for everyone.

## very high level plan

- implement core features - i.e. events & venues
- re-implement the homepage i.e. list of events for the current month
- import existing WP pages & keep them editable.
- when the site has some feature parity and covers most/all existing URLs, launch it as an alpha version.
- eventually replace the current site entirely.

## tech-y things

- [ONBOARDING.md](docs/ONBOARDING.md) lists the steps to get started with the codebase
- [DEVELOPMENT-CYCLE.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT-CYCLE.md) describes the development cycle i.e. open a branch + submit a PR, etc.

## who/when/where

[Jessica Hallock](https://jessica-hallock.com/) is the driving force behind [https://nyc-noise.com/](https://nyc-noise.com/).

The migration to Django is being tackled by a group of people from the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).
