- potentially look into django only serving as an api and using a cdn-distributed next.js middle/frontend for the frontend (using netlify?)
- the site could send emails? like an email calendar? with events for the next days? this requires coordination with Jessica as events get updated very frequently
- more/better devops
  - deploy `dev` branch to separate domain with own database
  - deploy PR previews i.e. each PR gets its own deployment url+database
- connect site in search console -- monitor new site issues/suggestions
- venues should have a default age/access value BUT every event should be able to optionally override those values
