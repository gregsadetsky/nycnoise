### development cycle i.e. how to contribute code

- work on a fix or feature in a separate branch (e.g. `git checkout -b my-fix`)
- keep branch up to date with main (e.g. `git pull origin main`)
- push code / branch to repo
- open PR
- go through a code review
- merge code to main
- delete branch
- repeat
